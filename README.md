Welcome to my first ever project on GitHub!
The folder is called Game, but it would be more accurate to call it a CLI-based 3d renderer -- you know, one of those ascii render things. 
Eventually it would be cool to get an actual Game working within the program (since that was the original intent of the thing), but for now
I'm just working on making the render portion work.

I seriously doubt anyone besides me will be reading this, but here's what's on the project at time of writing (9/10/24): 
  textRender.h    --> Contains prototypes and includes for the rendering part of the project 
  anim.h          --> Header for the animation functions
  textRender.cpp  --> Contains function implementation. All of the stuff needed to render a plane should be here.
  anim.cpp        --> Implementation for anim
  tempDriver.cpp  --> As the name implies, a temporary driver to test out features.

All of the basic next-steps of the project are commented in the tempDriver, at least for right now. 

Thanks for checking this out!
